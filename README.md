# Moodle Clone - A self project
To the reader,

I've been working on this for quite some time now. Currently I've implemented only HTML and CSS, as per my planning to create all the individual web pages first.

Can't wait for my first ever hands-on experience with JavaScript *(which would connect all the dots)* ;)
